## Memory/Concentration Game
This is a Python script simulation of the game Memory/Concentration.  Written to assist my son with one of his high school assessments for statistics or probability.

It counts the number of hits and misses and calculates the ratio based on the number of attempts.

It takes into account if the 'player' has seen cards previously by using a dictionary to store the cards.

### The rules
- A card is considered a match if it is the same value and the same colour: e.g. 2 of Hearts and 2 of Diamonds where both are red.
- The game concludes after a set number of attempts.
